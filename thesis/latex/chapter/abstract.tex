\chapter*{Abstract}

This work applies on the design and implementation of a software platform to
collect and to store system and application data of Big Data Analytics Applications.
On the example of Apache Flink and Apache Kafka as source systems, the \textit{Collector-Platform} will
be introduced, a streaming platform itself, as an open, flexible and distributed system architecture for collecting,
processing and storing data in millisecond ranges based on Flink, Kafka, Logstash and Elasticsearch.
