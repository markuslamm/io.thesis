\section{Stream-Processing}
Stream processing is the real-time processing of data continuously, concurrently, and in a record-by-record fashion.
in which data is treated not as static tables or files, but as a continuous infinite stream of data integrated from both live and
historical sources.

Benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accessibility: live data can be used while still in motion, before being stored.
	\item Completeness: historical data can be streamed and integrated with live data for more context.
	\item High throughput: high-velocity, high-volume data can be processed with minimal latency.
\end{itemize}
